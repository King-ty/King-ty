I am **Yu TIAN**, a final-year M.Phil. candidate in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Hong Kong (HKU). My research focuses on **Machine Learning Systems** and **Distributed Computing**.

I specialize in building high-performance infrastructure for Large Language Models. I’ve also delved into topics such as microservice, OLAP systems, trusted execution environments (TEE), and homomorphic encryption (HE). These experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in designing and optimizing complicated systems.
